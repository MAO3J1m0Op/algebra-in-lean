    -- If G is a group, then a subgroup of G is a subset of G that is itself a

    -- merely as subsets with additional properties.

      -- type. Upon viewing the Mathlib documentation for the set (if you are
      -- viewing this file in Visual Studio Code, you may Ctrl-Click on the
      -- keyword to consult its definiton), we see that it is merely a wrapper
      -- for `G → Prop`, meaning it is a function that determines what is and
      -- is not in the set.

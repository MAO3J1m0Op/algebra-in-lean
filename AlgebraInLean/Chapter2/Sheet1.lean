    universe u₁ u₂ u₃
    -- In Lean's type theory, the Calculus of Constructions, there is an infinite
    -- hierarchy of types that contain one another. Type 0 (or simply just "Type"
    -- is contained in Type 1, Type 1 is contained in Type 2, and so on. A type
    -- can never contain itself; if that were to happen, we would run into a
    -- logical paradox! We classify types using what are called "universes"; in
    -- other words, a universe is a family of types. For more information on
    -- Lean's type system, see
    -- https://lean-lang.org/theorem_proving_in_lean4/dependent_type_theory.html.

    variable {α : Sort u₁} {β : Sort u₂} {γ : Sort u₃}
    -- Type n is syntactic sugar for Sort (n + 1). Sort 0 is the bottom of the
    -- hierarchy; expressed as a Type, it would theoretically be written "Type
    -- -1". Using "Sort" allows for a bit more freedom for the range of types. In
    -- this case, you are free to think of α, β, and γ as sets.

    -- Surjectivity, injectivity, and bijectivity of maps
    def Injective (f : α → β) : Prop := ∀ (x y : α), f x = f y → x = y
    -- Otherwise known as "one-to-one".

    -- We have already seen many injective functions. One of them is the
    -- function which takes any group element to its inverse! (This is actually
    -- bidirectional.)

    example [Group G] : ∀ a b : G, ι a = ι b → a = b:= by
      intro a b
      intro hinv
      have hinj : ∀ (g : G), ι (ι g) = g -- probably shows up in earlier chapter
      · sorry
      rw [← hinj a, ← hinj b]
      rw [hinv]

    def Surjective (f : α → β) : Prop := ∀ (y : β), ∃ (x : α), f x = y
    -- Otherwise known as "onto".

    def Bijective (f : α → β) : Prop := (Injective f ∧ Surjective f)

    -- You've seen these definitions before in the `Interlude`. Go back there
    -- for a refresher on everything that follows from function composition.

  -- Given a group G and a group H, a homomorphism is a map φ from G to H
  -- which "preserves", or "respects" the group structure. I.e., given an
  -- element g ∈ G and h ∈ H,

  -- φ(gh) = φ(g)φ(h).

  -- An isomorphism has a slightly stricter definition in that φ is required
  -- to be a bijection. When two groups are isomorphic to each other, they are
  -- indisguishable from each other by structure alone. There are various
  -- examples of this correspondence: for example, homomorphisms (and
  -- therefore isomorphisms) map inverses elements of group G to corresponding
  -- inverse elements of group H. We will explore this and examples like these
  -- in the following exercise.

  def Homomorphism [Group G] [Group H] (φ : G → H) : Prop := ∀ a b : G, μ (φ

  Bijective φ)

  -- As expected, you can see how the process of proving isomorphisms in Lean
  -- might closely parallel pen-and-paper proofs: you split the definition of
  -- an isomorphism into its respective parts via a logical conjunction (or
  -- type class definition): (1) it is a homomorphism, and (2) it is a
  -- bijection, and then prove each part.

  -- Below are some basic proofs of homomorphisms: that they map inverses to
  -- inverses, and identities to identities.

  -- Tip: Since the only thing we know about a homomorphism φ is that φ (μ a b)
  -- = μ (φ a) (φ b), it is often instructive to start proofs by applying the
  -- inverse or the identity to an arbitrary element of the group, to exploit
  -- the "multiplicativity" of homomorphisms.

  -- TODO: Maybe add more basic exercises with homs... unsure of what exactly
  -- though

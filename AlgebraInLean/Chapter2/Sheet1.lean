    -- # Morphisms
    -- Morphisms are structure-preserving maps between objects in a category.
    -- In category theory, morphisms are arrows that connect objects and adhere
    -- to certain composition and identity rules.

    -- Examples of morphisms you may have seen before are functions between
    -- sets, homomorphisms between algebraic structures, continuous functions
    -- between topological spaces, etc.

    -- But before we dive into morphisms, we present a quick interlude about
    -- maps!

    universe u₁ u₂ u₃
    -- Brace yourself for a type theory interlude!
    -- In Lean's type theory, the Calculus of Constructions, there is an
    -- infinite hierarchy of types that contain one another. Type 0 (or simply
    -- just "Type" is contained in Type 1, Type 1 is contained in Type 2, and
    -- so on. A type can never contain itself; if that were to happen, we would
    -- run into a logical paradox! We classify types using what are called
    -- "universes"; in other words, a universe is a family of types. For more
    -- information on Lean's type system, see
    -- https://lean-lang.org/theorem_proving_in_lean4/dependent_type_theory.html.

    def Injective (f : α → β) : Prop := ∀ (x y : α), f x = f y → x = y
    -- Otherwise known as "one-to-one".

    -- We have already seen many injective functions. One of them is the
    -- function which takes any group element to its inverse!

    -- To do this, we need to prove two intuitive propositions: First, a simple
    -- group identity. Then, a proof that given a group G and an element g in
    -- G, the inverse of the inverse of g is g itself. In other words, the
    -- inverse cancels itself out.

    -- `calc`, like `have`, is an example of what is called "forward thinking"
    -- in Lean. Usually with tactic-style proofs, we are trying to go
    -- backwards, transforming our goal to one of our assumed hypotheses. With
    -- forward thinking, we are trying to transform our assumptions into the
    -- goal.

    -- `calc` might be more familiar than you think, since it closely reflects
    -- some pen-and-paper proofs via a chain of equalities and algebraic
    -- manipulations. Hover over `calc` to see the syntax.

  -- Given a group G and a group H, a group homomorphism (_group_ usually
  -- omitted) is a map φ from G to H which "preserves", or "respects" the group
  -- structure. I.e., given an element g ∈ G and h ∈ H,

  -- φ(gh) = φ(g)φ(h).

  -- In other words, you can combine g and h in G, and then apply φ, or apply φ
  -- to g and h each, before combining them in H. We omit the symbol for the
  -- operator for the sake of simplicity.

  -- An isomorphism has a slightly stricter definition in that φ is required to
  -- be a bijection. When two groups are isomorphic to each other, they are
  -- indistinguishable from each other by structure alone. This is often
  -- expressed via the phrase "equal up to isomorphism". We'll talk more about
  -- isomorphisms in the next sheet!

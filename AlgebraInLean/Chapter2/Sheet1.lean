    -- # Morphisms
    -- Morphisms are structure-preserving maps between objects in a category.
    -- In category theory, morphisms are arrows that connect objects and adhere
    -- to certain composition and identity rules.

    -- Examples of morphisms you may have seen before are functions between
    -- sets, homomorphisms between algebraic structures, continuous functions
    -- between topological spaces, etc.

    -- But before we dive into morphisms, we present a quick interlude about
    -- maps!

    universe u₁ u₂ u₃
    -- Brace yourself for a type theory interlude!
    -- In Lean's type theory, the Calculus of Constructions, there is an
    -- infinite hierarchy of types that contain one another. Type 0 (or simply
    -- just "Type" is contained in Type 1, Type 1 is contained in Type 2, and
    -- so on. A type can never contain itself; if that were to happen, we would
    -- run into a logical paradox! We classify types using what are called
    -- "universes"; in other words, a universe is a family of types. For more
    -- information on Lean's type system, see
    -- https://lean-lang.org/theorem_proving_in_lean4/dependent_type_theory.html.

    def Injective (f : α → β) : Prop := ∀ (x y : α), f x = f y → x = y
    -- Otherwise known as "one-to-one".

    -- We have already seen many injective functions. One of them is the
    -- function which takes any group element to its inverse! 

    -- To do this, we need to prove two intuitive propositions: First, a simple
    -- group identity. Then, a proof that given a group G and an element g in
    -- G, the inverse of the inverse of g is g itself. In other words, the
    -- inverse cancels itself out.

      -- there exists an x in α such that `g ∘ f` equals y; since g is
      -- surjective, we use the `have` tactic to express something we know must

  -- Given a group G and a group H, a group homomorphism (_group_ usually

  -- structure. I.e., given an element g ∈ G and h ∈ H,

  -- φ(gh) = φ(g)φ(h).

  -- An isomorphism has a slightly stricter definition in that φ is required to

/- To represent Cn, the group of rotational symmetries of an n-gon, we will
use a type already in mathlib called Fin. Fin n is just the type of all natural
numbers less than n. Elements are represented as a pair of a natural number,
and a proof that that number is less than n. -/

/- The value n will represent a rotation of (n / 360) degrees. -/

instance (n : â„•) (hpos : NeZero n): Defs.Group (Fin n) where
  /- Fin.add adds two elements in Fin n and then takes the result mod n. Since n is
  equivalent to a 360 degree rotation, this means that if you get a rotation over
  360 degrees, it gets changed to a rotation under 360 degrees. -/
  op := Fin.add

  /- Fin already has all of these proven, you just need to figue out what they are called.-/

-- This allows us to not have to say [Group G] when stating all the theorems below.
variable {G : Type*} [Group G]

/- When we defined groups, we only required existance of an identity and inverses. This means that
there could be multiple identities and inverse functions. However, this is not possible, and we can
show that the identity and inverse are unique. -/

/- Since the proof of op_inv used the previous definition of Group, we need to reprove it using the
new definitions. -/
theorem op_inv (a : G) : Œº a (Œπ a) = ùïñ := by
  rw [‚Üê(id_op (Œº a (Œπ a))), ‚Üê(inv_op (Œπ a))]
  rw [op_assoc, ‚Üê(op_assoc (Œπ a) a (Œπ a)), inv_op, id_op]


/- This proves that the identity is unique. This theorem only requires G to be a monoid, so that is
all we will assume. The obtain tactic may be useful for dealing with the and as a hypothesis. When
h is a hypothesis of P ‚àß Q, obtain ‚ü®h1, h2‚ü© := h creates hypotheses h1 and h2 which state P and Q
respectively. -/
theorem id_unique [Monoid M] (e2 : M) : (‚àÄ a : M, (Œº a e2 = a ‚àß Œº e2 a = a)) ‚Üí e2 = ùïñ := by

identity and inverses. -/

## Challenge Sheet

The next example of groups we will go over are the dihedral groups D‚Çô. Similarly to the cyclic
groups, the dihedral groups also represent symmetries on a regular n-gon. However, D‚Çô includes both
rotations and reflections. Feel free to skip this section and come back to it at a later time if the
content is overwhelming.

/--
The dihedral group D‚Çô has 2n elements: the n rotations already in C‚Çô, and the reflections of all
of these rotations (reflection first, then rotation).

D‚Çô is the first example we've seen of a non-abelian group. In fact, D‚ÇÉ is the smallest non-abelian
group.

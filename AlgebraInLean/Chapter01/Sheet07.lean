The last group we will cover in this section is the symmetric group. This is defined as the set of
all permutations of a set of n elements. This is formalized as the set of all bijections of a finite
set of size n onto itself. The group operation, therefore, is function composition.

For example, S3 has 6 elements, which permute the tuple (1, 2, 3) into one of: (1, 2, 3), (1, 3, 2),
(2, 1, 3), (2, 3, 1), (3, 1, 2), or (3, 2, 1).

In Lean, we use the `Equiv` type, notated `Œ± ‚âÉ Œ≤`, which is the set of all bijections from a type
`Œ±` to a type `Œ≤`.

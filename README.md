# Algebra In Lean

This is the repository for Algebra In Lean (AIL), an interactive problem set
that takes users through an advanced course in Lean through the lens of abstract
algebra. The goal of this problem set is to introduce users to formalization and
Lean 4 while also assisting in writing rigorous proofs in abstract algebra.
After an introduction to logic-based reasoning in Lean, each chapter takes users
through various topics in group theory. Akin to Kevin Buzzardâ€™s [Formalising
Mathematics](https://www.ma.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/formalising-mathematics-2024)
at Imperial College London, AIL includes chapters on group axioms,
homomorphisms, and subgroups, each separated into problem sheets. These problem
sheets include both the formalization of mathematical structures and exercises
on proving related theorems.

Also included in AIL is the [Lean
Blueprint](https://mao3j1m0op.github.io/algebra-in-lean/blueprint/), which
provides a dependency graph of lemmas and definitions, a top-down view of
formalization progress, and a bottom-up view of individualized nodes. While this
problem set presents an extensive introduction to the formalization of algebra
and group theory mathematics, there is much left for future contributors. We
hope that others will add to the problem set in the future, including examples
related to quotient groups, group actions, Sylow theorems, ring theory, and much
more.

## Local installation

First you need to install Lean 4. Instructions for doing that are
[here](https://leanprover-community.github.io/get_started.html#regular-install).

Then you will need to clone this repository from github onto your computer. Open
up the same command line which you used to install Lean 4 and type:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MAO3J1m0Op/algebra-in-lean.git
cd algebra-in-lean
lake exe cache get
```

Now open the folder `algebra-in-lean` which you just created, using
VS Code's "open folder" functionality. You will find all the exercises for the
course inside a subdirectory called `AlgebraInLean`.

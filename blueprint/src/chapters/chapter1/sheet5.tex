\section{$C_n$ as a Group}

    $C_n$ is the generalization of $C_3$, and is therefore the group of
    rotations of a regular n-gon. It uses mathlib's \verb|Fin n| type, and
    addition on that type. Since Fin allows modular arithmetic, rotations that
    are seperated by a multiple of $360^{\circ}$ are treated as equal. Similarly
    to $C_3$, the identity is a $0^{\circ}$ rotation, and the inverse of an
    $x ^{\circ}$ rotation is a $(360 - x)^{\circ}$ rotation.

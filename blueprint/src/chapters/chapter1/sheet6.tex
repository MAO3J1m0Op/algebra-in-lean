\section{$D_n$ as a group}

\begin{definition}[$D_n$]

    \uses{definition : Group}
    $D_n$ is the dihedral group of order $2n$. This is the group of all
    symmetries of a regular n-gon. This includes n rotations and n reflections.
    It is represented by a pair of a boolean and an element of Fin n. The
    boolean represents whether the element is a rotation or not, and the element
    of Fin n represents how much the first vertex is rotated. The identity is a
    $0 ^{\circ}$ rotation, the inverse of an $x ^{\circ}$ rotation is a $360 - x
    ^{\circ}$ rotation, and any reflection is its own inverse.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[$D_3$ is nonabelian]

    \uses{definition  : Dn}
    $D_3$ is the first example we've seen of a nonabelian group:
    $\neg (\forall a, b \in D_3, \mu(a, b) = \mu(b, a))$
\end{theorem}

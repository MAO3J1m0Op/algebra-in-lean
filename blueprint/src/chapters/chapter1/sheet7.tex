    $S_n$, the symmetric group of order $n!$, is the set of all
    permutations of $n$ elements. It is represented as the set of all bijections
    from \verb!Fin n! to \verb!Fin n!, with function composition as the group
    operation. The identity is the identity function, and the inverse of a
    group element is its inverse function (which exists since all bijections
    are invertible).

    $S_n$ is the symmetric group of order $n!$. This is the set of all
    permutations of n elements. It is represented as the set of all bijections
    from Fin n to Fin n, with function composition as the group operation. The
    identity is the identity function, and the inverse of a function is its
    inverse function (which exists since all bijections are invertable).

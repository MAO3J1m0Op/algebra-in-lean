    $(\mathbb{Z}, +)$, the integers with addition, is a group. $0$ is the identity,
    and the inverse of x is -x.
\end{definition}

    \uses{definition : Group}
    $C_3$ is the group of rotational symmetries of an equilateral triangle under
    composition. This is treated as an inductive type with three elements. The
    identity is a $ 0 ^{\circ} $ rotation, and the inverse of an  $x ^{\circ} $
    rotation is a $360 - x ^{\circ} $ rotation.

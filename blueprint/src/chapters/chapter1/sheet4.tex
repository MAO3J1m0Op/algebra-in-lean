    \uses{definition : Group}
    $(\mathbb{Z},~ +)$, the integers over addition, form a group, The identity
    of the group is $0$, and the inverse of an element
    $x \in \mathbb{Z}$ is $-x$.
\end{definition}

    $C_3$ is the group of rotational symmetries of an equilateral triangle with
    the group operation being the composition of symmetries.
    This is treated as an inductive type with three elements. The
    identity is a $ 0 ^{\circ} $ rotation, and the inverse of an  $x ^{\circ} $
    rotation is a $(360 - x)^{\circ} $ rotation.
